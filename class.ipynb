You can\n","    concatenate ordinary characters, so last matches the string 'last'.\n","    \n","    The special characters are:\n","        \".\"      Matches any character except a newline.\n","        \"^\"      Matches the start of the string.\n","        \"$\"      Matches the end of the string or just before the newline at\n","                 the end of the string.\n","        \"*\"      Matches 0 or more (greedy) repetitions of the preceding RE.\n","                 Greedy means that it will match as many repetitions as possible.\n","        \"+\"      Matches 1 or more (greedy) repetitions of the preceding RE.\n","        \"?\"      Matches 0 or 1 (greedy) of the preceding RE.\n","        *?,+?,?? Non-greedy versions of the previous three special characters.\n","        {m,n}    Matches from m to n repetitions of the preceding RE.\n","        {m,n}?   Non-greedy version of the above.\n","        \"\\\\\"     Either escapes special characters or signals a special sequence.\n","        []       Indicates a set of characters.\n","                 A \"^\" as the first character indicates a complementing set.\n","        \"|\"      A|B, creates an RE that will match either A or B.\n","        (...)

Non-grouping version of regular parentheses.\n","        (?P<name>...)
